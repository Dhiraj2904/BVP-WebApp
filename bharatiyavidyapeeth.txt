Website with static data
Online learning
1. At a high level change the UI tii ok make it user friendly and look like a professional site 
2. It has bootstrap so we need to ensure it works fine on most popular mobiles in India
3. An angular UI calling the Django API would make it crisp
4. Look for improvements and list them to be prioritized by business 
5. Any missing functionality to be called out too
6. Estimate the efforts and create a fixed price proposal. 
I will share a confirmation on scope .
Do share any aspect I may have missed
